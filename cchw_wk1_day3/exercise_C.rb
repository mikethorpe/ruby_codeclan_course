## Exercise C

### Given the following data structure:

united_kingdom = [
  {
    name: "Scotland",
    population: 5295000,
    capital: "Edinburgh"
  },
  {
    name: "Wales",
    population: 3063000,
    capital: "Swansea"
  },
  {
    name: "England",
    population: 53010000,
    capital: "London"
  }
]
### Complete these tasks:
#
# 1. Change the capital of Wales from `"Swansea"` to `"Cardiff"`.
united_kingdom[1][:capital] = "Cardiff"

# 2. Create a Hash for Northern Ireland and add it to the `united_kingdom` array
#(The capital is Belfast, and the population is 1,811,000).
northern_ireland = {
  name: "Northern Ireland",
  population: 1811000,
  capital: "Belfast"
}

united_kingdom.push(northern_ireland)

# 3. Use a loop to print the names of all the countries in the UK.
for country in united_kingdom
  p country[:name]
end

# 4. Use a loop to find the total population of the UK.
total_uk_population = 0

for country in united_kingdom
   total_uk_population += country[:population]
end

p " The total UK population is #{total_uk_population}"
